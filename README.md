# kagefunc
kageru's (that's me) Vapoursynth functions\
Functions outside of `kagefunc.py` are currently in development and will probably not even run.\
Documentation/explanation for each function is given in the docstring.\
`tests.py` contains the tests and is mostly used by me for development or if you want to test the functions locally.

## Installation
A list of dependencies can be found [in the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vapoursynth-plugin-kagefunc-git).
If you’re on Arch Linux, [the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vapoursynth-plugin-kagefunc-git) is also the recommended method of installation.
If you’re not, I recommend [switching to Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/download/). :^)

The plugin for adaptivegrain (core.adg) can be found [here](https://git.kageru.moe/kageru/adaptivegrain/releases).
